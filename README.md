# Knex/Bcrypt-Passport-Local Guided Exercise

## Getting Started
```
git clone https://github.com/johnazre/passport-local-guided.git
cd passport-local-guided
yarn OR npm install
createdb fsauth
knex migrate:latest (To migrate the users database)
```

## Overview
There are only 2 files that you need to modify:
  - `./routes/authRoutes.js`
  - `./config/auth.js`

There will be a branch called something along the lines of `completed` or `working` after the breakout is over that contains the solution.

Things coming later?
 - Add sessions?
 - Add cookies?
 - Add JWT?
